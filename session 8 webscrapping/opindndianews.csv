Moitra had reported Dehadrai to the police after repeated violations.The notification further stated that Dehadrai attempted to get journalists to write false articles about Moitra but was unsuccessful due to a lack of evidence to back up the allegations. Dehadrai approached Dubey when journalists could not be persuaded, the notice claimed. It further stated that Dubey went on to repeat the allegations against the TMC MP and that he “did not even bother to conduct any due diligence of any kind to establish the veracity of the allegations.”The notice further added that Dubey and Dehadrai have cropped and leaked private morphed photos of Moitra. Dubey was asked to retract his letter to the speaker, all of his accusations, and to publicly apologize to Moitra.
